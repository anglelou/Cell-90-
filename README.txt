Project #1 Cella Rule 90
Team ASD
Member(s): Angel Soto

Intro: 	The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Rule 90 of Cellular Automaton, however,
	this project is an example of poor time management as a result from external factors.
	The main source code such as the algorithm has been borrowed from Devin Acker's Github.
	I was unable to implement my own version of the algorithm as shown in "js-2"
	and am submitting this mess with Acker's permission to use his free source code.

Contents: 
	draw-stuff.js, styles.css, js-1.html, js-2.html (not necessary)

Errors/ Bugs/ Etc:
	- Was not able to successfully implement the javascript into a separate file from the main html.
	- could not successfully trim down excess code without resulting in compile errors


How to handle the JS-1 files to get results:

1. Main HTML file is js-1.html, a web page inside "webpage" folder.
2. Sibling folder (at same level as .html) is "assets".
  (You can move this folder elsewhere if you change js-1.html accordingly.)
3. Web page links to (loads) assets/styles.css, a very simple CSS file.
4. Web page has some HTML markup for title, header and text.
5. After body, web page loads a script file from assets with fcns.
6. After that, another Script section defines another function.
7. And then runs some "loose" Javascript commands.
8. Be sure to have both folders in a parent folder.

How to show (and run) the web page:
8. Drag and drop the html file onto a browser to see what it does.
   (Double-Clicking on "js-1" should also work.)
9. Click on "Start" button.

(*) Key: use fcn key F12 to open a "javascript console" in your browser
and see what might be going wrong: errors and warnings.
